Application Programming Interfaces

what are APIs?
An API is a set of commands, functions, protocols and objects
that programmers can use to create software pr interact with an external system.

It is a barrier to your programme and the external system. Your program request some data from external system
and the external system will response with data that you are requested if you followed all the procedures and
rules that applies.
if we want data from an external system then you need to know where exactly the data located
it is called API endpoint (to ask for the location we API request)

International Space station current API
http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json
{"message": "success", "timestamp": 1626807629, "iss_position": {"latitude": "27.8883", "longitude": "107.8612"}}


example1:
when you go to a restaurant the place gives you a menu which is an API between you and the kitchen
you order some food and the kitchen will deliver.

example2:
going to the bank to check your account summary, you ask help from the bank teller. So the bank teller
 is an interface to you and the bank.

we are going to extract data from other websites using APIs today

import requests

response=requests.get(url="http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json")
print(response) ###<Response [200]>  response code

Response Code
404 - the thing that you are looking for then the website will return 404
1XX - Hold on something is happening it is not final
2XX - all good
3XX - Go away - you don't have permission here
4XX - you screwed up . doesn't not exist
5XX - server is down or it is screwed up

https://httpstatuses.com for more response statuscode.

There are so many status code and it will eb difficult to check the error/exceptions
so python has requests module
response.raise_for_status()
